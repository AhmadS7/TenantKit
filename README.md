# TenantKit

> **Production-Ready Multi-Tenant SaaS Boilerplate**  
> Built by **Ahmad Shah** — because every SaaS founder deserves a secure, scalable foundation without rebuilding auth, billing, and tenancy from scratch.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

**TenantKit** is engineered for developers and teams who are tired of:

- Rebuilding authentication, roles, and permissions for every new SaaS project
- Worrying about one tenant accidentally seeing another tenant's data
- Wrestling with Stripe webhooks, subscription states, and billing logic
- Spending weeks on DevOps before writing a single line of business logic
- Tutorial-grade boilerplates that break the moment you try to deploy them

If you are an **indie hacker**, **agency owner**, **startup CTO**, or **full-stack engineer** who needs to ship a multi-tenant SaaS in days — not months — this is your starting line.

## 🚀 What TenantKit Solves

Most SaaS boilerplates give you a login page and call it a day. TenantKit gives you a **battle-tested architecture** that handles the hard problems so you can focus on your product:

| Problem | How TenantKit Solves It |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Tenant Data Leakage** | PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) + AsyncLocalStorage request isolation — every query is scoped to the current tenant by default |
| **Auth Complexity** | JWT access/refresh tokens with rotation, reuse detection, role-based access control (RBAC), and atomic user+tenant provisioning |
| **Billing Nightmares** | Stripe Checkout + Webhooks with idempotency, grace periods, plan tiers, and a mock sandbox mode for local development without API keys |
| **Frontend/Backend Sync** | Next.js 15 App Router with Server Actions, automatic tenant context propagation, and JWT refresh handling |
| **Deployment Anxiety** | Complete Terraform AWS infrastructure (ECS Fargate, RDS, Redis, ALB) with CI/CD pipeline and Docker Compose for local development |
| **Security Blind Spots** | Helmet headers, strict CORS, input validation, sanitized error responses, and CloudWatch monitoring out of the box |

```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **RLS + Application Filtering**: We use PostgreSQL RLS as a safety net, but enforce tenant isolation at the application layer via `AsyncLocalStorage` — eliminating connection pool leakage risks.
- **Schema-per-Tenant is Overkill**: RLS on shared tables scales to 10,000+ tenants without operational complexity.
- **Request-Scoped Everything**: Tenant context lives in `AsyncLocalStorage`, not global variables or connection sessions.

## ✨ Features

### Multi-Tenancy
- ✅ Subdomain routing (`tenant.yourapp.com`)
- ✅ Custom domain support (`client.com`)
- ✅ Automatic tenant resolution via middleware
- ✅ Tenant-aware repository base class (all queries filtered by default)
- ✅ Atomic tenant provisioning (user + tenant + owner membership in one transaction)

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT access tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- ✅ Refresh token rotation with reuse detection (instant session revocation)
- ✅ Role-based access control: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 failed attempts per 15 minutes)
- ✅ Password reset with signed, single-use tokens
- ✅ Soft delete on all entities (audit trail preserved)

### Billing & Subscriptions
- ✅ Stripe Checkout integration

## 👤 About the Author

**Ahmad Shah** is a self-taught software engineer with 10+ years of experience building production systems across frontend, backend, and infrastructure. TenantKit was built to solve a real problem: every SaaS project starts with the same 3 months of boilerplate. This is the boilerplate I wish I had when I started.

> *"I built TenantKit because I was tired of rebuilding auth, billing, and tenancy for every client project. Now I spin up a new SaaS in hours, not weeks. I hope it saves you the same time."* — **Ahmad Shah**
